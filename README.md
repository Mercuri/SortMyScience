## ℹ️ Overview

Oops!  You just circumnavigated Duna and left ForScience! running and now you have hundreds of experiments stored in your science container!  Some can be transmitted for full science, some are repeats best tossed into a processing lab, and some you'd rather kept for return and recovery.  Oh, and some are duds without any scientific value left whatsoever...DOH!  And did I mention there are HUNDREDS of them?  What are you going to do?

Well, it's time to SORT MY SCIENCE!
