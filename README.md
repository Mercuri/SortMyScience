 ## 🧪 SortMyScience

You just circumnavigated Duna, hopped over to Ike, confirmed that Dres is _probably_ real, and left poor Bob running experiments the whole time. Now your science container is jam-packed with hundreds of random results, and that “Review Stored Data” button is staring at you like a boss fight.

Some results are perfect for transmission, some belong in a lab, some are worth bringing home… and some are worthless duds you’d rather pretend never happened. And did I mention there are hundreds of them?

Time to hit the panic button.<br>
Time to SORT MY SCIENCE!

## 🚀 Highlights

- Automatically sorts every experiment in your science containers!
- Transmit, discard, process, or keep data using fully configurable thresholds!
- All done with one glorious click!
- MOAR BULLET POINTS! MOAR EXCLAMATION MARKS!!!11!

## 📘 How It Works

Sort My Science automatically processes every stored experiment using a simple, configurable set of rules:

### 1. Transmit if Worth It
If an experiment’s transmit value vs. recovery value meets or exceeds your transmit threshold _(default 100%)_, and an antenna is available, the data is immediately transmitted using the best antenna onboard.

### 2. Send to Lab if Recovery Is Low
If it isn’t transmitted and its remaining recovery value has dropped below your lab threshold _(default 1%)_, the experiment is routed to the best available science lab for processing.

### 3. Discard “Dead” Science
If an experiment has no remaining lab value and no recovery value, it’s considered scientifically exhausted and is discarded automatically _(if this option is enabled and below the threshold)_.

### 4. Keep Everything Else
Any experiment that doesn’t meet the above conditions is safely kept for later review or recovery.

## ✈️ Usage
- Open the Results Dialog by clicking "Review Science Data" on a science container.
- Click the new "Sort My Science" button in the bottom corner
- Watch as it goes through all your science automatically and gives you a summary message.
- Customize the options in the Settings menu
