 ## 🧪 SortMyScience

You just circumnavigated Duna, visited Ike, Discovered that Dres actually exists (lies!) and accidentally left ForScience! running the entire time.  Oops!  Now you have hundreds of random experiments stored in your science container and that "Review Stored Data" button is looking rather intimidating...

Some can be transmitted for full science, some are repeats best tossed into a processing lab, and some you'd rather keep for return and recovery.  Oh, and some are duds without any scientific value left whatsoever...DOH!  And did I mention there are HUNDREDS of them?  What are you going to do?

Well, it's time to SORT MY SCIENCE!

## 🚀 Highlights

- Automatically sort through all the experiments in your science containers!
- Transmit, Discard, Process, and Keep experiments based on configurable thresholds!
- Just takes one click!
- MOAR BULLET POINTS AND EXCLAMATION MARKS!!!!11!

## ℹ️ Overview

Sort My Science evaluates every experiment in a results dialog:
1. If the transmit value versus the recovery value is above the threshold (default 100%), then it immediately transmits the science back home through the best antenna available (if a connection is available).
2. Otherwise, it checks to see if the recovery value is below a certain percentage of the original full value (default 0%).  If so, then it shoves that experiment into the best available lab (if an available lab exists).
3. Then it checks to see if the experiment has no lab or recovery value.  If so, then it just discards the experiment.
4. Everything else is kept as is.

## ✈️ Usage
- Open the Results Dialog by clicking "Review Science Data" on a science container.
- Click the new "Sort My Science" button in the bottom corner
- Watch as it goes through all your science automatically and gives you a summary message.
- Customize the options in the Settings menu

## ⬇️ Installation
Install via CKAN

Alternatively extract the latest release into your KSP\Gamedata folder

## 🔭 Compatibility

This mod hooks into the stock mechanisms used by the Experiment Results Dialog and therefore should not have any compatibility issues.  It even works with DMagic's Science Relay mod despite using the same mechanism to inject itself into the UI.

I'm Mercuri with thousands of hours in KSP.  As an avid consumer of KSP mods, I thought it was time I authored my own.  I'm a nub though so please forgive.

## 🎉 Acknowledgements

Sort My Science based on Science Relay by DMagic and adopts the same MIT license.  I couldn't have made this without his expertise.
